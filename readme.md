# What is it?

KISS IDE is a simple web based "Integrated Development Environment".  "IDE" is in quotes because initially, at least, it is mostly a simple
filesystem tree with a text editor (although, a pretty good editor named ACE from Cloud9).  More things are planned for the future, but it is 
very usable as is to edit text files on the server on which it is installed.  This makes it very convienent to say edit Wordpress themes and plugins
or develop custom PHP, Python (maybe Django), Ruby (Rails), Node.js, etc. websites.

# Installation Requirements

* Apache
* PHP 5.4 (PHP 7 has not been tested)
* SQLITE3
* PHP SQLITE module

Although the current installation is setup for Apache, it should be straight forward to set it up with Nginx.  It is designed to be an alias like
phpmyadmin.
